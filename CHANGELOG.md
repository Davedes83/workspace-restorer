## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-30

### Browser tabs now restore correctly

- Fixed browser tab restore when browsers are already running: no more split-screen windows (Firefox), extra session-restore tabs (Vivaldi), or windows landing on the wrong workspace.
- Changed browser windows with captured tabs are now closed and relaunched fresh at restore time, so each opened window shows exactly the tabs from your snapshot — one window, no duplicates, on the correct workspace.
- Fixed a launch-script stall that could stop a restore partway through.

> **Note:** restoring a snapshot with browser tabs will close and reopen the matching browser window. Capture snapshots without browser tabs if you prefer not to have browsers relaunched.
